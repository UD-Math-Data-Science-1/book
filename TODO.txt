* different scaler preprocessors
* Better examples in clustering for inertia, silhouette (multidimensional, step by step)
* Exercise 6.6a, fix ties in the distance matrix
* Exercise 6.5, clarify the clusterings and what "function of z" means
* silhouette median versus mean for scoring
* networks/butterfly: histograms are varied by # of bins, etc; don't use float as index!
* (True,True) for log-log axes?
