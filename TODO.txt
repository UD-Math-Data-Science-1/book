* (True,True) for log-log axes?
* don't leave blank-looking cells in lab notebooks
* Exercise 4.1: word more clearly, make explicit connections to formulas and equations  in the text
* Exercise 4.2: Walk through making a table of actual and predicted test values. Change the testing set to demonstrate variance.
* caution about cuts to make classifications
* remove R^2
* Exercise 5.10: unweighted regression, k=2, inf norm, give a few examples of values.



* use simpler tools for ROC curves (can't for > 2 classes)
