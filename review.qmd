- What is the CDF of a uniform distribution? How does it differ for discrete and continuous cases?
- What is an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF)?
- How does the shape of the ECDF change as the sample size increases?
- Define the probability density function (PDF) and explain its relationship to the CDF.
- Discuss the concept of a histogram and its normalization.
- Describe formulas for computing the mean and variance of a continuous distribution from its PDF.
- What are the mean and variance for a continuous uniform distribution over $[0, 1]$?
- What are the characteristics of a standard normal distribution?
- How do the mean and variance of a normal distribution affect its PDF?
- Discuss the 68-95-99.7 (empirical) rule in the context of the normal distribution.
- What does kernel density estimation (KDE) do?

### Section 2.3: Grouping

- Why might it be useful to analyze data in groups defined by categorical values or other criteria?
- What is a facet plot?
- Describe the information conveyed by a box plot and a violin plot. 
- Describe how aggregation works with grouping in data analysis. What are some common aggregation functions?
- Describe how transformation works with grouping in data analysis. What are some common aggregation functions?
- What is the purpose of filtering in grouped data analysis?
- Discuss the impact of standardizing data within groups versus across the entire dataset. 


### Section 2.4: Outliers

- What is an informal definition of an outlier?
- Why might outliers be of real interest in certain applications?
- List some common reasons why outliers might appear in a dataset.
- Provide an example where changing a single value in a dataset significantly affects the mean but not the median.
- What is the Interquartile Range (IQR), and how is it calculated?
- Describe how outliers are identified using the IQR method.
- How are outliers represented in a box plot?
- What are the criteria for considering values as outliers in a normal distribution based on standard deviation?
- Discuss the potential impact of removing outliers on the analysis of a dataset. When might it be appropriate to remove outliers, and when might it be important to investigate them further?

### Section 2.5: Correlation

- Define correlation in the context of statistical analysis.
- Why is it important to visually inspect data before calculating correlation coefficients?
- Define covariance and explain its significance in measuring the relationship between two variables.
- Why is covariance not always easy to interpret?
- Explain the Pearson correlation coefficient and how it is calculated for both populations and samples.
- What does a Pearson coefficient of -1, 0, and 1 signify?
- How does the Pearson coefficient address the limitations of covariance?
- Discuss how outliers can affect the Pearson correlation coefficient.
- Provide an example where a single outlier significantly impacts the Pearson coefficient.
- What is the Spearman correlation coefficient, and how does it differ from the Pearson coefficient?
- How does the Spearman coefficient mitigate the impact of outliers?
- Provide an example demonstrating the robustness of the Spearman coefficient against outliers.
- Explain how correlation can be assessed when dealing with categorical variables.

### Section 2.6: Cautionary tales

- What is the main lesson from the Datasaurus Dozen example?
- How can relying solely on summary statistics be misleading?
- Explain the difference between correlation and dependence.
- Describe an example where two variables are dependent but not correlated.
- What is Simpson's paradox, and how does it manifest in the penguin dataset example?
- Can you create a hypothetical example where Simpson's paradox might lead to incorrect conclusions if not properly understood?
- Why is it important to consider both linear and nonlinear relationships when analyzing data?
- How can the misuse of statistical methods lead to misconceptions or mistakes?
